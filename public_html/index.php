					Sometimes we seem to be saying that Jesus put on a costume for a little while and just played the part of being human. The issue is the transcendence of God as opposed to the immanence of God. Those who are theological liberals have a tendency to err on the side of immanence, ignoring the divine. Those of us who are orthodox and Bible-believing have a tendency to err on the side of transcendence, ignoring the humanity of God in the incarnation.
					I once taught about the incarnation of Christ at a conference and, in order to make the incarnation clear, I said, “Jesus blew his nose just the way you do.” A very angry lady came up to me afterwards and said, “That’s blasphemous!” I asked her why and she said, “It just is!”
